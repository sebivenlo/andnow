# formats.

The following formats will be used for any atrifacts of the type document.

 - Syllabus: LaTeX processed with sebi venlo specific styles.
 - Task descriptions: LaTeX with specific exam styles.
 - sheets: LaTeX using the beamer package.
 - Projects: whatever is most apropriate, for instance ant  netbeans projects or projects with a maven stucture.

To use LaTeX on Windows I would prefer the TexLive installation with TexStudio, since this is and behaves the same on all platforms.

We will maintain Bibliography in this repo as well.

Places:

 - The latex styles and scripts will be maintained in sebivenlotex
 - the bibtext 'library' in sebivenlobib
 - any scripts needed for formatting, pre of postprocessing in lscripts

To easily integrate the styles into your LaTeX installation, you can sym-link these into your ~/textmf tree.
